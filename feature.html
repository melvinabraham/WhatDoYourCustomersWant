       <b> Bubble Chart </b>uses opinion words as data points and plots them with the additional dimension of size of the
        bubble which shows how frequently that word is mentioned for a particular feature, as well as colors which
        signify the sentiment of the of the data. Intensity of the colors specify how much they have been used in
        previous years as well.
        In this graph ‘green’ color is used for positive opinion words, ‘red’ for negative opinion words and ‘blue’ for
        neutral words. If the same words are repeated in the previous years then it will get darker which shows how
        frequent that word was mentioned by the customers over the years. This is achieved by normalizing the number of
        mentions for every opinion word in a particular year, and using this to set the color of the bubble.

      <div class="column">
        <b>Scatter Plot </b>shows the comparison between reviews and ratings given by a customer for a particular
        feature. This plot uses Cartesian coordinates to compare the data by using the size of the data points to aid in
        comparison to our data.

        Colors add the dimension of sentiment, and in helping sellers understand the emotion associated with every
        opinion word. We have used ‘blue’ for neutral rating, ‘green’ for positive reviews and ‘red’ for negative
        reviews. In addition to this, the colors go from a lighter shade to a darker shade based on how frequently the
        word has been used in the years before. This helps the sellers get insight into what are the most common ways
        that customers describe their products, and also allow for easy analysis of any kind of criticism that the
        customer might have for that particular feature.
