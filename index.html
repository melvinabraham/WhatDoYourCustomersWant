        Using a Stacked Bar Chart, we have compared the top 8 features mentioned by customers for a particular year. We
        also added an year wise slider, so that the user can get insight into how the importance of these features
        changed over the years. In addition to this, the mentions are divided into the following sub-categories:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Positive and Neutral Mentions</b>: The positive mentions of the product are highlighted by the colors
            speciﬁed
            in the legend. The diﬀerent colors are helpful in identifying the features that are prone to change over a
            period of time.
          </li>
          <li><b>Negative Mentions</b>: The negative mentions of the product are highlighted by red color. We chose red
            color
            to ensure clarity and allow the user to diﬀerentiate it from positive and neutral mentions respectively.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <b>Conclusions: </b>
        <ul>
          Battery remains the most talked about feature across all the years, with 26000+ mentions.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          We see a large spike in mentinons about "camera" and "screen", from 2008 onwards, which is explained by the
          boom of iPhones and Android touch screen phones.

        </ul>

      <div class="column">

        In the above graph, we have added another comparative dimension to our analysis of cell phones data over the
        years (2003 - 2014). Here, we compare the top 8 features mentioned in the Stacked bar graph in association with
        5 diﬀerent quantitative variables which are the top 5 most reviewed brands in the selected year. Using this,
        sellers can determine the top 8 features that buyers are looking for in a cell phone and how they vary based on
        brands over the years.

        <br>
        <b>Conclusions    </b>:
        <br>For example, the orange color radar, representing the brand ‘Sony Ericsson’, shows how the
          brand performs with respect to the top 8 features of the year. The legend in this graph diﬀerentiate the
          diﬀerent brands and the slider enables the users to select diﬀerent years.
